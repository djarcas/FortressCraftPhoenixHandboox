					<Text>After building your Cloning Vat in a stack, 3 blocks high, simply provide it with enough power to grow a new clone, then select it and press Interact (E). From then on if, or indeed when, you die, you'll spawn back at the same location. 
          
This location is also used as the default spawn location for new players on multiplayer servers.</Text>
