					<Text>The Cyberdyne Bar Repossession System is a machine used to take the bars from a players inventory. This machine is intended to prevent unintentional theft of resources when a player logs off. Unlike both its predecessors the ore and Garbage thief hinders rather than helps players when placed in hallways. When playing on a server this machine should be set in a central location that is accessible to all players yet labeled in an obvious way so as not be activated unintentionally.

					Simply build our brand-new Bar Repossession System (tm) in a 3x3 layout and supply with a mere 5 power per Bar, then just stand on it and let IT do the hard work for you!</Text>
