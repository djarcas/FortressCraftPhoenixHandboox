					<Text>The construction paste grinder utilizes a primitive version of the suits inorganic re-assemblers to create construction paste from useless materials like the various rock and soil types found on this new planet. The machine itself is able to be assembled by using the minerals found in the planet&#39;s topsoil. The low cost of manufacturing this machine and its nonexistent power requirements make it possible to run several in parallel. Setting up a garbage thief in a frequented hallway attached to multiple of these machines is a good way to get a large amount of construction paste early in the game.</Text>
