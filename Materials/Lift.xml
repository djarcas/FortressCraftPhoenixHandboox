				<Paragraph>
					<Text>A lift with a piston which raises and lowers a platform. A wireless connection to your suit allows the lift to raise or lower automatically to your location when you approach the lift shaft. This can be augmented with a manual control module to allow precise movement at the behest of anyone using the lift. A lift can move significantly faster when not encumbered by the weight of a player, and will do so if a player is detected near the lift shaft at any height reachable by the lift.</Text>

					<Text>Interact (default &#39;E&#39;) with the lift to adjust the maximum range, fine tune with alternate interact (default &#39;Shift+E&#39;). Upgrade the lift with powered compressors to regenerate gas faster, maintaining performance for heavily-used lifts. A powered compressor is already required for the lift to extend beyond 64m (32m in lowest detail setting).</Text>

          <Text>Please note : The 64m limitation for multiplayer is a technical one, not for reasons of gameplay, and it is recommended you use Teleporters or Advanced Teleporters long-distance movement in network games</Text>
