					<Text>The Suit Power Pack MK1 is an additional mountable battery that increases the suit’s native internal buffer of 256 power units to 512 power units. This upgrade is primitive and has room for further improvement. Further improvement of this upgrade is impossible until a better heat conducting material can be found to assist in the necessary cooling technology so that the power storage units’ ambient heat does not compromise the suit’s life support systems.</Text>
