					<Text>The logistics hopper is a cheaper version of the standard storage hopper which can store just 2 items but can process items as quickly as a storage hopper. The logistics hopper is suitable as an output hopper for an ore extractor without any upgrades. You should look to upgrade logistics hoppers if they become a bottleneck.</Text>
