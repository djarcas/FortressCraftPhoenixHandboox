					<Text>The Build gun V2 is an upgraded version of the build gun more suitable to be used in the alien environment. The upgrades to the base build gun allow it to mine through tougher materials and more advanced machinery. Despite this upgrade in technology the cooling systems for the grapple function is still inadequate, for rapid use in the cold caverns and other areas with poor air quality a better quality heat conductor will be needed. Only one of these upgrades is needed to improve the functionality of the base tool, additional Build Gun V2 upgrades have shown to provide no additional benefits at this time without extreme loss. </Text>
