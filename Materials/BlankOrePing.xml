					<Text>The Blank Ore Ping is used in conjunction with a sample of ore to craft an ore ping filter. These filtered ore pings are designed to allow us to find more ore veins of the same type if the one previously discovered is nearing exhaustion or was too small to be of any use.</Text>

This will feed it into the ore scanner and a filtered ping will be dispatched by the scanner and also displayed on the Holobase. The ore ping is consumed in the process.</Text>
