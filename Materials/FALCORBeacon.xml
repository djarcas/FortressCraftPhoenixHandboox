					<Text>The Fully-Automated Loot Collector Organisational Robots (or FALCOR for short!) Beacons can be used in one of three different modes.

					If the Beacon was placed on the floor, then it will collect items within 16 meters in all directions and hold it until a MK1 FALCOR is free to collect.

					If the Beacon was placed on top of a Storage Hopper, then it will collect items from that Storage Hopper and hold it until a Logistics FALCOR is free to collect.
					
					If a Beacon is added to the Spiderbot the Beacon will Pickup Loot around the Spiderbot. SpiderCor Drones need to collect the Loot then from the Beacons. (Only two Beacons required)

					FALCOR bases do not require power, neither do Storage Beacons. Collector Beacons however require power.
					
					For the first and second Beacon types a Clearance of at least 16m above them is required.
