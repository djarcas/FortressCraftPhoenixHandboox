					<Text>The HerbiCOR Collects nearby outdoor unharvested Plants and returns them. This is a destructive process, but scans show that a single HerbiCOR should be able to reach between 7 and 10 thousand plants. It may take many hours to clear the area, but this should be more than enough organics for all our needs. Needs attached storage hopper.</Text>
