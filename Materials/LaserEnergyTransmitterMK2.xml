					<Text>Laser Energy Transmitters (or LETs) are the backbone of your power delivery network, they can send power over a distance of up to 64m and can deliver it directly to machines, power storage blocks, or another LET to extend the range.</Text>

				<Paragraph>
					<Text>To open the control panel for the LET press the &#39;Interact&#39; key (default &#39;E&#39;). This allows you to upgrade the lens which will boost power transfer. You can also switch the firing mode so that it will wait for a full battery before sending power. LETs have a small internal capacity, consider complementing them with Power Storage Blocks to ensure a reliable supply of power as supply and demand vary.</Text>
