					<Text>As the cheapest and most basic of power transmission devices this transmitter is unsuitable for any task and should only be used when it is left as the only option remaining.</Text>

					<Text>The basic laser energy transmitter can only transmit enough power to run two un-upgraded ore extractors. Because of its extraordinarily low transmitting speed, upgrading to a more advanced transmitting option is advised once one has been discovered.</Text>

					<Text>To open the control panel for the LET press the &#39;Interact&#39; key (default &#39;E&#39;). This allows you to upgrade the lens which will boost power transfer. You can also switch the firing mode so that it will wait for a full battery before sending power. LETs have a small internal capacity, consider complementing them with Power Storage Blocks to ensure a reliable supply of power as supply and demand vary.</Text>
