					<Text>The Build Gun is a tool made from repurposed parts from the crashed ship. The build gun allows rapid construction and destruction of materials in the environment. The basic build gun has not been assembled for the new alien environment and therefore has extreme limitations in its functionality. Due to the build guns rudimentary cooling for the grapple function, any drops in air pressure or quality may cause a brief cooldown period where activation is impossible for a few moments after a grapple.</Text>
