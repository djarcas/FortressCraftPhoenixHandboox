          <Text>  - Any PSB will filter out total Base Power.
  - Any Ore or Bar will filter out only that type of resource.

  - BioMass, Crystal and Coal will also filter the appropriate types.</Text>

          <Text>The Base Efficiency refers to the ratio of Ores to Bars created; if it's greater than 100%, you're not collecting enough Ore; if it's less than 100%, you're not Smelting enough bars.</Text>
