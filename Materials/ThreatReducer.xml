					<Text>The native wild life appear to react negatively to the byproducts dispersed into the air by industial actions. In an effort to mitigate both current and future conflict with the native wild life devices have been cuntructed to minimize the impact of machinery. The Threat reducer is able to cancle out the electro magnetic waves created by power production and scrub the nearby atmosphear of pollutants. The device utilizes 5 power units per second to complete this task. </Text>

					<Text>In an effort to further understand the natives reactions to industilization, a new system to measure our impact based on the studied organisms sensitivity to both chemical and electromagnetic pollution has been created. This system measures these factors in “Threat Units” and can be seen in the Threat Scanner. Each active Threat Reducer reduces the threat by approxametly 50 threat units. With enough of these devices the produced threat can be completely minimized no matter how extensive operations grow on this planet.</Text>
