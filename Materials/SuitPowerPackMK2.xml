					<Text>The Suit Power Pack MK2 is an additional mountable battery that improves upon its predecessor by increasing the suitâ€™s native internal buffer. This upgrade again doubles the internal buffer from 512 power units to 1024 power units. While the cooling issues have been henceforth solved an additional issue has reared its head. A further upgrade in capacity is, unfortunately, impossible until a new material for a more advanced electromagnetic shielding system can be found.</Text>
