					<Text>Organic Solar Panels are a low maintenance source of renewable power. They must be placed with direct access to the sky above them and will generate power during the day and at a reduced rate during the night. They will distribute this power to any adjacent machine, Power Storage Block or Laser Power Transmitter.</Text>
