					<Text>After creating a location marker place it in your hotbar, select it, and point your build gun at the desired location. Then press the Build button (default &#39;LMB&#39;). If successful your suit&#39;s heads up display will display a column of light on the targetted spot while the location marker is selected.</Text>

					<Text>Please note that your suit does not support interacting with more than one location marker at a time therefore we recommend only carrying a single location marker in your inventory at one time to avoid confusion.</Text>
