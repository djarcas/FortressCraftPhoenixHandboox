					<Text>Attach to the base of a piston lift to improve the rate at which gas is regenerated, maintaining the performance of heavily-used lifts. This compressor must be externally powered. A compressors are required on a lift to achieve the maximum height of 256m. Please note that due to technical limitations, Multiplayer Lifts are limited to 64m; a 'waterfall' of lifts is the best solution here.</Text>

          <Text>Please note : The 64m limitation for multiplayer is a technical one, not for reasons of gameplay, and it is recommended you use Teleporters or Advanced Teleporters for long-distance movement in network games</Text>
