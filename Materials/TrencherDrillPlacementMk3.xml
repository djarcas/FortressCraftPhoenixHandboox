					<Text>These massive multi-block drilling machines can be used to harvest all known materials in a very rapid fashion. To build one, you&#39;ll need to build the drillhead in a 3x3x3 layout, then the motor in a 3x3x3 fashion, touching it. The Trencher&#39;s facing is dictated by this; the motor always goes at the back. You can use this to make Trencher face any angle, including straight up!</Text>

					<Text>Be aware that these new drills are very power-hungry, and can drop off hundreds of ore per minute. You&#39;ll need to think big when it comes to moving this stuff up to the Cold Caverns for smelting - Cargo Lifts and Minecarts are the order of the day!</Text>
