					<Text>The Build Gun V3 is a further upgrade on the already upgraded Build Gun. This upgrade provides suitable cooling to facilitate rapid continuous activations of the grapple function. Along with the increase in cooling capacity, the Build Gun V3 allows for the destruction of tougher materials and the disassembling of more advanced machinery. Only one of these upgrades is needed to improve the functionality of the tool, additional Build Gun V3 upgrades have shown to provide no additional benefits at this time without extreme loss.</Text>
