					<Text>The power storage block MK4 can hold a reserve of up to 270,000 energy. It will take energy from multiple attached generators and provide it to any attached machines or power transmitters. Multiple power storage blocks will share energy between themselves however this is not efficient for transmission of energy across more than a few blocks, laser power transmitters should be used instead for this purpose.</Text>
